# Cursor AI Rules for MedWave Project

## Documentation Policy - STRICT
- NEVER create markdown (.md) files unless explicitly requested
- NEVER create documentation files for completed work
- NEVER create summary documents, quick reference guides, or implementation notes
- NEVER create README files proactively
- ONLY create .md files when user specifically says "create documentation" or "write docs"
- Keep all explanations in chat responses only

## Response Style
- Be direct and concise
- Show code changes inline in response
- Explain what was done briefly in chat
- Don't document your work in files
- Focus on actual code implementation

## Code Changes
- Make the changes requested
- Explain briefly what was changed
- Test if needed
- Move on - don't create documentation artifacts

## When Documentation IS Allowed
- User explicitly says: "create documentation", "write a guide", "make a README"
- User asks: "can you document this?"
- User requests: "write instructions for..."

## Summary
If the user didn't ask for documentation, DON'T CREATE IT.
