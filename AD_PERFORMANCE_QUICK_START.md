## ⚡ Pro Tips

1. **Use the expand buttons wisely** - Click campaigns to see what's inside without switching tabs

2. **Hover over charts** - Interactive tooltips show exact numbers

3. **Combine filters** - Date filter + campaign filter + profitability filter = laser focus

4. **Watch the status badges** - "Paused" campaigns might need attention or removal

5. **Check conversion %** - Low booking rate? It's a sales team issue, not ad quality

6. **Top 5 is your focus** - Don't overthink the bottom performers, optimize the top

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**No data showing?**
- Click the refresh button (top right)
- Check date filter - might be too restrictive
- Verify Facebook sync status (blue badge at top)

**Numbers don't match Facebook?**
- This combines FB data + GHL conversion data
- Profit includes your product costs from admin config
- Last synced time shown in blue badge

**Tabs not switching?**
- Try collapsing/expanding the section
- Refresh the page

**Charts not showing?**
- Need at least 1 ad with data
- Check if date filter is excluding data

## 📱 Next Steps After Implementation

1. **Test with Real Data**: Go through each tab with your actual campaigns
2. **Set Benchmarks**: What's your target CPL? CPB? Profit margin?
3. **Train Your Team**: Show them where to find key metrics
4. **Create Review Cadence**: Daily summary check, weekly optimization
5. **Monitor Trends**: Use date filters to compare periods
